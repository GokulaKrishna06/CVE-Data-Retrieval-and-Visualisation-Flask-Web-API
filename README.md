# CVE-Data-Retrieval-and-Visualisation-Flask-Web-API
This application retrieves and synchronizes CVE data from the NVD API, cleanses and de-duplicates it, and stores it in MongoDB database. The backend, built with Flask, manages data and API calls, while the frontend uses HTML, CSS,JavaScript, Bootstrap for user-friendly viewing and filtering of CVE details.
